# Singapore Zoo
This is a simple redesign of the current Singapore Zoo.

Singapore Zoo is a one-of-a-kind wildlife experience. Our zoo offers visitors a chance to get up close and personal with some of the world's rare and endangered species. With over 4200 species of animals, our zoo is a family-friendly destination that offers something for everyone. From our interactive wildlife encounters to our educational programs and fun activities, Singapore Zoo is the perfect place to connect with nature and learn about the importance of conservation. Come visit us today and experience the wonders of the animal kingdom.

## Design Process

This website is built as a way to allow very simple interactions for the people are interested in coming to Singapore Zoo to see
all of the many attractions and a way to contact us as well as find out more about the people behind the scenes. 

The design principles this was built on was simplicity, appealing and being as colorful as possible.
